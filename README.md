# 🚗 **Smart Braking System with Arduino** 🚦  

[![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20With-Arduino-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.arduino.cc/)

🌟 **A safety-first braking system using IR sensors, a servo motor, and a relay module to detect obstacles and engage brakes automatically or manually!**

---

## 🛠️ **Features**  
- **Obstacle Detection**: IR sensors scan for nearby objects and trigger the brakes.  
- **Manual Control**: Engage brakes using a switch.  
- **Smooth Servo Braking**: A servo motor moves precisely to engage/disengage brakes.  
- **Power Management**: Relay cuts off power to other systems during braking.
